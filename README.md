# Encrypted API
Encrypted API packages provide secure and authenticated communication between two applications over the internet. Two shared secrets are used,
one for encryption and decryption using `aes-256-ctr`, other for checksumming the data using `sha512-hmac`. All request and response data
between applications are transmitted encrypted. Each request and response is valid for maximally 10 seconds. HTTPS endpoints are not a
requirement, but are recommended.

# Server implementations
Server implementations ([Laravel](https://github.com/kbs1/encrypted-api-server-laravel), [PHP](https://github.com/kbs1/encrypted-api-server-php))
implement replay attacks protection and IPv4 whitelisting. Request URL, query string and HTTP method verb are checked after decryption, so that the request
can not be stolen and sent to a different service endpoint.

Multiple calling applications are supported.
Each calling application has it's own set of shared secrets. This distinguishes and authenticates each calling application on the server side, and makes
sure no caller is able to read any service response or send any service request except of their own.

# Client implementations
Client implementations ([PHP](https://github.com/kbs1/encrypted-api-client-php), [NodeJS](https://github.com/kbs1/encrypted-api-client-nodejs)) provide
a convenient way to call any Encrypted API service. Each client verifies the service response to make sure it is valid and was not tampered with.

# Summary
The setup as a whole protects using MITM attacks, authenticates both the server and the caller, and offers protection against replay attacks, over
plain HTTP, or HTTPS.

This repository contains implementations of encryptor, decryptor and shared secrets generator.

# Tests
To run the tests suite, invoke `composer install` after cloning the repository, then run `./vendor/bin/phpunit`.
